          Laundry Bubbles connects people who need clothes washed, dried, or sewn with local washers who set their own
          availability, pricing, and style. Clients pay washers directly using modern payment apps—no hidden fees, no
          corporate middle layer.
        </p>

          When you sign up, you’ll see exactly how the app works—for both clients and washers—before you place or accept
          a single load. If you get stuck, email: <strong>boardwalkclay1@gmail.com</strong>.

            • Create a profile with your basic info and preferred payment methods (Apple Pay, Cash App, PayPal, debit card note).<br>
            • Request a pickup with your address, notes (delicates, stains, repairs), and timing.<br>
            • A washer accepts your load, picks it up, washes/dries/sews as agreed, and returns it.<br>
            • You pay the washer directly using the payment method you both agree on—Laundry Bubbles does not hold or move money.

            • Create a profile with your skills (wash, dry, fold, sew), service area, and payment handles.<br>
            • Set your availability and watch incoming requests in your dashboard.<br>
            • Accept jobs you want, chat with clients (later), pick up, complete, and return loads.<br>
            • Get paid directly by clients via Apple Pay, Cash App, PayPal, or card—no platform payout delays.

          <p>
            Laundry Bubbles is a connection platform only. We do not handle clothing, do not supervise washes, and do not
            guarantee results. All washing, drying, sewing, and handling of garments is performed by independent washers.
            By using this app, both clients and washers agree that Laundry Bubbles is not responsible for missing, damaged,
            or altered items. Any disputes, refunds, or replacements are handled directly between client and washer.
          </p>

          <br>

          <div class="disclaimer-title">Agreements & expectations</div>
          <p>
            By continuing, you agree that:<br>
            • Clients clearly describe items, special care needs, and any existing damage.<br>
            • Washers treat every load with care and communicate honestly about what they can and cannot do.<br>
            • Payments are made directly between client and washer using mutually agreed methods.<br>
            • Laundry Bubbles provides the tools to connect, message, and track—not financial, legal, or cleaning services.
